title: About
---

I am currently a fourth year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University. My work is jointly supervised by Professors [Peter Hoff](http://pdhoff.github.io) and [Sayan Mukherjee](http://sayanmuk.github.io).

Prior to coming to Duke, I worked with Aviad Tsherniak on the [Cancer Data Science](http://www.cancerdatascience.org) team at the Broad Institue of MIT and Harvard. I contributed to the [Cancer Dependency Map](https://depmap.org/portal/) and analyzed data from the [PRISM](https://depmap.org/portal/prism/) profiling method.

As a PhD student, I have continued to work with cancer genomics data, for which I developed a [Bayesian tensor model](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa053/6322375?guestAccessKey=7ed9d6f4-b90d-47c9-8475-5e8055e836fe) to distill information from several experimental modalities. More recently, I have been working on inference strategies and algorithms for semiparametric models using ideas from optimal transport.

My interests outside of Statistics include:

- Music
- Russian language and literature
- Meditation and the science of the first-person
