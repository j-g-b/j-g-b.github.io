title: About
---

I am currently a fourth year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University. My work is jointly supervised by Professors [Peter Hoff](http://pdhoff.github.io) and [Sayan Mukherjee](http://sayanmuk.github.io).

Prior to coming to Duke, I worked with Aviad Tsherniak on the [Cancer Data Science](http://www.cancerdatascience.org) team at the Broad Institue of MIT and Harvard. I contributed to the [Cancer Dependency Map](https://depmap.org/portal/) effort with a focus on data analysis for the [PRISM](https://depmap.org/portal/prism/) profiling method.

As a PhD student, I have continued to work with cancer genomics data, with a particular eye towards using [tensor models for datasets with several experimental modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07887). More recently, I have been spending time thinking about statistical inference problems using ideas from optimal transport.

My interests outside of Statistics include:

- Music
- Russian language and literature
- Meditation and the science of the first-person
