I"=<p>This post follows the table at the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior">Conjugate prior Wikipedia page</a> to derive posterior distributions for parameters of a range of likelihood functions. Many resources for learning the mechanics of posterior inference under conjugate priors <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/CompendiumOfConjugatePriors.pdf">already exist</a>, so thereâ€™s nothing particularly new to be seen here. However, maybe others learning about Bayesian inference will find this useful as a supplement to other resources.</p>
