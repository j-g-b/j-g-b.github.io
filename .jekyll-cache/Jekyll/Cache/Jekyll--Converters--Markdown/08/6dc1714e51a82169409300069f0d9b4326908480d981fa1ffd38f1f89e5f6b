I"1<p>I am currently a first year PhD student in the <a href="https://stat.duke.edu">Department of Statistical Science</a> at Duke University.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to Duke, I worked with Aviad Tsherniak on the <a href="http://www.cancerdatascience.org">Cancer Data Science</a> team at the Broad Institue of MIT and Harvard. I contributed to the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/">Cancer Dependency Map</a> effort with a focus on data analysis for the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/prism/">PRISM</a> profiling method. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Stanford, where I studied mathematics, creative writing and jazz performance.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy reading Russian novels and short stories. I also like to play jazz drums. Some day, I hope to become a bassist and trumpet player as well.</p>
