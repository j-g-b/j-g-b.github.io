I"0<p>Neural networks have become popular tools for transfering the style of one artistic work or photograph to another. Methods for performing style transfer are distinguished from one another by features of the neural networkâ€™s design as well as the loss function that guides network updates. In a recent project, I teamed up with <a href="https://stat.duke.edu/people/alessandro-zito-0">Alessandro Zito</a> to use a method based on the theory of <strong>optimal transport</strong> to transfer visual elements of musical instruments onto the forms of animals. The method was developed by Vince Marron and is available on his <a href="https://github.com/VinceMarron/style_transfer">GitHub Page</a>.
