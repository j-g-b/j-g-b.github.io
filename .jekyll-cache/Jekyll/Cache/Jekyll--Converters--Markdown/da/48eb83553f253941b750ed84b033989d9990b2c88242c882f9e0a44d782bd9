I"‹<p>The Cancer Data Science team and others at the Broad Institute came out with an article in <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">Nature Communications</a> today detailing a new method for normalizing and integrating multiple large RNAi screening datasets. It‚Äôs called DEMETER2, named after the Roman goddess of the harvest.</p>

<p>DEMETER2 uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate gene dependency scores in cancer cells from measurements of multiple shRNAs. Like the original <a href="https://depmap.org/rnai/">DEMETER</a>, DEMETER2 accounts for the effects of ‚Äúseed sequences‚Äù that align to multiple sites in the genome.
