I")<p>Suppose that, following the design of the <a href="https://j-g-b.github.io/journal/well-data.html">previous well contamination study</a>, a new group of researchers wants to conduct a survey to characterize the effect that distance to the nearest safe drinking water source has on well switching behavior. For the next study, we would like to estimate the number of residents that need to be polled in order to achieve high power in our test for the distance effect. Classical methods of power calculation assume that observations are independent of one another. Our analysis of the data from the previous well study called this assumption into question. We propose using a modified bootstrap sampling method called the Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) to appropriately preserve the dependence structure in the data during power calculation. We compare the MBB results to those obtained from parametric and non-parametric alternatives and show that taking into account the additional dependence increases the number of samples required to achieve a given power.</p>
