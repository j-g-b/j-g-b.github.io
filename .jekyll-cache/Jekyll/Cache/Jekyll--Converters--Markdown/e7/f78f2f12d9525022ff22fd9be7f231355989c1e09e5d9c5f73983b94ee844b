I"Ô<p>I am currently a fourth year PhD student in the <a href="https://stat.duke.edu">Department of Statistical Science</a> at Duke University. My work is jointly supervised by Professors <a href="http://pdhoff.github.io">Peter Hoff</a> and <a href="http://sayanmuk.github.io">Sayan Mukherjee</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to Duke, I worked with Aviad Tsherniak on the <a href="http://www.cancerdatascience.org">Cancer Data Science</a> team at the Broad Institue of MIT and Harvard. I contributed to the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/">Cancer Dependency Map</a> and analyzed data from the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/prism/">PRISM</a> profiling method.</p>

<p>As a PhD student, I have continued to work with cancer genomics data, for which I developed a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa053/6322375?guestAccessKey=7ed9d6f4-b90d-47c9-8475-5e8055e836fe">Bayesian tensor model</a> to distill information from several experimental modalities. More recently, I have been working on inference strategies and algorithms for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07465">semiparametric models using ideas from optimal transport</a>.</p>

<p>My interests outside of Statistics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Music</li>
  <li>Russian language and literature</li>
  <li>Meditation and the science of the first-person</li>
</ul>
