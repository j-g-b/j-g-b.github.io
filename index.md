I am a postdoctoral trainee in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. My work is supervised by [Didong Li] and [Haibo Zhou].

As of January 2024, I am the Secretary of the [Junior Section of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (j-ISBA)](https://j-isba.github.io/index.html)

In May 2023, I received my PhD in Statistics from the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University where I was advised by [Peter Hoff]. Prior to that, I was an Associate Computational Biologist with the [Cancer Data Science](http://cancerdatascience.org) team at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
