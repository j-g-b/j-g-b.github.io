I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science at the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu) at the University of Virginia.

I study and develop statistical methodsÂ for the analysis of multivariate data in the natural sciences, including the fields of environmental monitoring, high energy physics, and cancer genomics.  My work touches on diverse topics in Bayesian statistics, linear models, robust estimation, and information-assisted hypothesis testing.

Before joining UVA, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I was supervised by [Didong Li] and supported by [Haibo Zhou] and [Kari North] through T32 training grants provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

I received my PhD in Statistics from the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University where I was advised by [Peter Hoff]. Prior to that, I was an Associate Computational Biologist with the [Cancer Data Science](http://cancerdatascience.org) team at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

As of January 2024, I am the Secretary of the [Junior Section of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (j-ISBA)](https://j-isba.github.io/index.html).
