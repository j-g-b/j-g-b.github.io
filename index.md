I am a postdoctoral trainee in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. My work is supervised by [Didong Li] and [Haibo Zhou].

In May 2023, I received by PhD in Statistics from the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University where I was advised by [Peter Hoff]. Prior to that, I was an Associate Computational Biologist working at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
