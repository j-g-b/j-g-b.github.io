Let \\(\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(\boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^p\\) and consider the model

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{Y} | \boldsymbol{\beta} &\sim N(\mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta}, \tau^2 \mathbf{I}) \\
    \boldsymbol{\beta} &\sim N(0, \psi^2 \mathbf{I})
\end{aligned}
$$

The parameters \\(\psi^2\\) and \\(\tau^2\\) represent, respectively, the variation due to "signal" -- i.e. that coming from the linear relationship between \\(\mathbf{Y}\\) and \\(\mathbf{X}\\) -- and the variation due to noise, which cannot be explained by \\(\mathbf{X}\\).

Under this model, the induced marginal density on \\(\mathbf{Y}\\) is

$$
p(\mathbf{Y}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi |\mathbf{A}|}} \exp \left\{-\frac{\mathbf{Y}^T \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{Y}}{2}\right\}
$$

where the marginal covariance of \\(\mathbf{Y}\\) is 

$$
\mathbf{A} = \psi^2 \mathbf{X} \mathbf{X}^T + \tau^2 \mathbf{I}
$$

As long as the rows of \\(\mathbf{X}\\) are not mutually orthogonal -- which would make \\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\\) equal to the identity -- variation due to \\(\psi^2\\) and variation due to \\(\tau^2\\) can be disambiguated. In fact, under certain conditions, maximum likelihood estimators for \\(\psi^2\\) and \\(\tau^2\\) are available, even when \\(p > n\\). 

The log-likelihood in terms of \\(\psi^2\\) and \\(\tau^2\\) is

$$
\ell(\tau^2, \psi^2) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \log 2\pi + \log |\mathbf{A}| + \mathbf{Y}^T \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{Y} \right)
$$

Differentiating the log-likelihood with respect to \\(\psi^2\\) and \\(\tau^2\\) relies on [Jacobi's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi%27s_formula) for the derivative of a matrix determinant as well as differentiation with respect to the matrix in a quadratic form. After simplifying the resulting expressions, the partial derivatives are

$$
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \psi^2} = -\frac{1}{2} \left(\text{tr}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{X}) -  \mathbf{Y}^T \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{Y} \right)
$$

and

$$
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \tau^2} = -\frac{1}{2} \left(\text{tr}(\mathbf{A}^{-1}) -  \mathbf{Y}^T\mathbf{A}^{-2} \mathbf{Y} \right)
$$

Setting both of these equal to zero produces the system

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{tr}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{X}) &=  \mathbf{Y}^T \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{Y} \\
\text{tr}(\mathbf{A}^{-1}) &=  \mathbf{Y}^T \mathbf{A}^{-2} \mathbf{Y} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Letting \\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{Q}^T\\) be the orthogonal eigendecomposition of the symmetric matrix \\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\\), \\(\mathbf{A}\\) may be written as

$$
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} (\tau^2 \mathbf{I} + \psi^2 \mathbf{D})\mathbf{Q}^T
$$

from which it is clear that the eigenvalues of \\(\mathbf{A}\\) are 

$$
\tau^2 + \psi^2 s_i^2, ~~~~~ i = 1, \dots, n
$$

where \\(s_i\\) is the \\(i^\text{th}\\) singular value of \\(\mathbf{X}\\). The system of equations giving the maximum likelihood estimators of \\(\psi^2\\) and \\(\tau^2\\) then becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\tau^2 + \psi^2 s_i^2} &=  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{||\mathbf{Q}_i^T \mathbf{Y}||_2^2}{(\tau^2 + \psi^2 s_i^2)^2} \\
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{s_i^2}{\tau^2 + \psi^2 s_i^2} &=  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{s_i^2 ||\mathbf{Q}_i^T \mathbf{Y}||_2^2}{(\tau^2 + \psi^2 s_i^2)^2} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

If the columns of \\(\mathbf{X}\\) are orthogonal, then \\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\\) is the orthogonal projection matrix onto the column space of \\(\mathbf{X}\\) (denote by \\(\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}}\\)) and its eigenvalues are equal to either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). 

Assuming \\(n > p\\), \\(\mathbf{X}\\) has \\(n - p\\) singular values equal to \\(0\\). Hence, \\(\mathbf{A}\\) has eigenvalue \\(\tau^2\\) of multiplicity \\(n - p\\). These correspond to eigenvectors that form an orthonormal eigenbasis for the space \\(\mathbb{R}^n / \mathcal{C}(\mathbf{X})\\).  Thus, subtracting the second equation from the first in the system above yields an explicit solution for \\(\hat{\tau}^2\\):

$$
\hat{\tau}^2 = \frac{\mathbf{Y}^T(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}})\mathbf{Y}}{n - p}
$$

Plugging this value for \\(\tau^2\\) into the second equation in the system yields

$$
\hat{\psi}^2 = \frac{\mathbf{Y}^T \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}} \mathbf{Y}}{p} - \frac{\mathbf{Y}^T(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}})\mathbf{Y}}{n - p}
$$

If \\(p = n\\) and the columns of \\(\mathbf{X}\\) are still orthogonal, the system of equations does not yield a unique solution (the first and the second equations become equal when all singular values are equal to \\(1\\)). If \\(p > n\\), then \\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\\) has no eigenvalues equal to \\(0\\) and the system will have a solution as long as the eigenvalues are not all equal. 

This suggests a close connection between the distribution of the singular values of \\(\mathbf{X}\\) and the feasibility of disambiguating \\(\psi^2\\) and \\(\tau^2\\).
