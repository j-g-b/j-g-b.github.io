I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call “Knightian freedom”: a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as possibly outside the scope of science.},

	abstract = {Prior to becoming a man of letters, F.M. Dostoevsky (1821-1881) studied at the Main Engineering School [Glavnoe inzhenernoe uchilishche] in St. Petersburg from 1838 to 1843. Although most scholars discount the lasting legacy of his engineering studies, the literary aesthetics of his works communicate an awareness of mathematical principles and debates. In the context of nineteenth-century Russian literature, Dostoevsky is perhaps the only major novelist to have embedded explicit mathematical expressions and terminology in his prose. His works, for example, contain references to “square roots”, “logarithmic tables”, “repeating decimals”, and the curious equation, “2x2=5.” After he was arrested, submitted to mock execution by firing squad, and sentenced to penal servitude in Siberia for his involvement in the revolutionary Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, most of his books and journals from the period of his education were confiscated, and destroyed by the Third Section of the Russian Secret Police. This dissertation reconstructs the curriculum and readings that Dostoevsky encountered during his studies, and connects such sources to the mathematical references and themes in his published works. Whereas scholars tend generally to underestimate, or even outright ignore the legacy of his studies at the Main Engineering School, my project presents his education as a formative period of his artistic development. This dissertation unearths subtexts in works by Dostoevsky, reiterating veins of mathematical thought, which evolved throughout Classical Antiquity, the Renaissance, and the Scientific Revolution. Extending the arguments set forth in Liza Knapp’s 1996 book The Annihilation of Inertia: Dostoevsky’s Metaphysics, this dissertation illuminates mathematical elements and discourses derived from a selection of his most popular literary texts, including Zapiski iz podpol’ia (1864), Prestuplenie i nakazanie (1866), Igrok (1867), Son smeshnogo cheloveka (1877), and Brat’ia Karamazovy (1881). Whereas Knapp explores the formulation of Dostoevsky’s existential philosophy in relation to his knowledge of Newtonian mechanics and physics, my project considers his knowledge of geometry and number theory as the disciplines that contributed to the holistic conception of his metaphysical ideas. His works, for instance, convey explicit acknowledgement of Non-Euclidean geometric principles devised by Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792-1856), and implicit allusion to advances in complex number theory proposed by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783). Both Lobachevsky and Euler conducted research in Russia that seems to have reached the attention of Dostoevsky during his schooling and subsequent reading. As an artist, Dostoevsky participated in multifarious polemics. He engaged contrasting worldviews in the formulation of his own synergistic outlooks, combining principles from the traditions of literature, spirituality, and mathematics. By engaging the sources from which Dostoevsky derived such integrative inspiration, and studying his narrative methods, this dissertation explores his interdisciplinary imagination. The genius of Dostoevsky can be viewed through a new lens that aligns his creative insights with the foundational frameworks of modern mathematics.},

The analysis shows that if second-order logic is understood in its full semantics capable of characterizing categorically central mathematical concepts, it relies entirely on informal reasoning. On the other hand, if it is given a weak semantics, it loses its power in expressing concepts categorically. First-order set theory and second-order logic are not radically diﬀerent: the latter is a major fragment of the former.},

	abstract = {In 2010, Vladimir Voevodsky gave a lecture on "What If Current Foundations of Mathematics Are Inconsistent?" Among other things he said that he was seriously suspicious that an inconsistency in PA (first-order Peano arithmetic) might someday be found. About a year later, Edward Nelson announced that he had discovered an inconsistency not just in PA, but in a small fragment of primitive recursive arithmetic. Soon, Daniel Tausk and Terence Tao independently found a fatal error, and Nelson withdrew his claim, stating that consistency of PA was an "open problem." Many mathematicians may find such claims bewildering. Is the consistency of PA really an open problem? If so, would the discovery of an inconsistency in PA cause all of mathematics to come crashing down like a house of cards? This expository article attempts to address these questions, by sketching and discussing existing proofs of the consistency of PA (including Gentzen's proof and Friedman's relative consistency proof that appeals to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem). Since Nelson was a self-avowed formalist, the article also examines the implications of formalism.},
