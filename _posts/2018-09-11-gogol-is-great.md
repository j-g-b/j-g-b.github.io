In some of what I have read and heard said about Gogol, I find a fetishizing note. If I could be so bold as to invent some straw men (for later hacking to pieces), I would summarize them in the following faux sentiments:

> "How *delightfully* strange his stories are! The genius in them is the absurdity."

> "Isn't Kovalyev such a dupe, thinking only of his rank? Not bothering himself with the deeper problem of living in a world where noses take corporeal form and strut about?"

> "Gogol's *The Nose* is a brilliant political indictment of the early 19th century Russian corporate stooge."

Not so, I claim. Gogol's characters are not mere stooges, nor mere spectacles for our indulgence. They are heroes of an uncharacteristic variety, but heroes nonetheless.

We are drawn into empathy with them because when they are faced with the unfathomable, they put their tiny powers to the task of coping with it. They are much like us: every day the impossible fact of being a lump of animate flesh stares us in the face, yet we go about our worldy business without giving much thought to it. We use our limited faculties, which lie within our limited view of the world, to muddle through problems whose solutions - if they exist at all - lie so far beyond our comprehension as to render the search for them more ridiculous than the flailing to which we often resort. 

In *The Nose*, Kovalyev's predicament is a metaphysical disaster involving his own body. In *Nevsky Prospect*, Piskaryov and Pirogov (and the narrator to some extent) are besieged by their own fantasies. In both cases, Gogol's characters fail to see this "deeper truth" about the nature of their difficulties. If Priogov were to self-report what was the matter at any given moment, he might complain about the German's wife and her indifference to his charm, but he would say nothing of how his potent self-concern is the primary source of his suffering. That realization lies outside himself, as it does for Kovalyev and Piskaryov. That is why we laugh at Gogol's heroes, yes, but if we are honest with ourselves (and a little bit kind) we have no choice but to admire them as well.

We are not meant to disparage the dupes in Gogol's tales; we are meant to understand that we are dupes along with them. Gogol's writing is beautiful because it shakes us from our delusions when we listen to it. His writing is not political (Nabokov heartily agrees), it is deeply personal. We don't read Gogol to smirk at the witless Majors in our lives who pompously parade their noses while we -- the smart few -- live in the bright glow of the "truth." We read Gogol to remember the fact that most of our waking hours are spent enacting the same frantic, self-blind search that Kovalyev, Piskaryov and Pirogov undertake. The joy we feel when we read Gogol is not spiteful or frivolous; it stems from the great relief we feel as, however briefly, we stand outside our daily madness and see it as something apart from ourselves.
