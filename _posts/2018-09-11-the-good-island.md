*The Island* checks all the right boxes when it comes to Russian film. It has stunningly bleak landscapes, a haunting choir as its soundtrack, and powerful emotions suppressed under mute expressions. So what sets it apart from others like it? For me, its success lies in what Father Anatoly has to tell us about "the good life" as described by the (modern?) Russian mind.

Father Anatoly rhetorically asks (not a direct quote),

> "What did I do to deserve this? I am nothing, and yet they want to make me a saint."

What indeed? Well, he flagelated himself for over thirty years, breathing in coal and filth and living off of little more than dirty chai (not the good kind invented by millenials). It doesn't seem like much. But to the Russian, intense punishment -- when it is taken without resistence -- imbues one with wisdom. In Father Anatoly's case, this wisdom manifests itself in borderline supernatural insight and healing abilities, gifts that tell the viewer that he is on the "right" path.

We can also approach this question from the other direction, asking "what is *not* the good life?" To answer this, we can look to the character who earns the lions share of Father Anatoly's (and through him the viewer's) scorn. Father Job is grade-grubbing, conspicuously authority-pleasing, "pious" (in the annoying sense). His contrast to Father Anatoly tells us that vanity is a higher order of sin than impropriety -- something that is perhaps not true in the Puritan-American mind.
